Data Collection
The data for this project is sourced from Project Gutenberg. We specifically use the text of "Pride and Prejudice." The text is downloaded and saved in a local file named pride_and_prejudice.txt.


To train the model, we create sequences of tokens. Each sequence consists of a fixed number of words (defined by seq_length). The model will learn to predict the next word in the sequence based on the previous words.


Model Architecture
The model is a simple feedforward neural network structured as follows:

Embedding Layer: Converts the integer-encoded tokens into dense vectors of fixed size.
Flatten Layer: Flattens the output from the embedding layer.
Dense Layers: A hidden layer with 128 neurons using ReLU activation, followed by an output layer with softmax activation.

Training the Model
The model is compiled using sparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. We also implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.


After training, we can generate text based on a seed phrase. The generate_text function performs the following:

Converts the seed text into a sequence of integer tokens.
Predicts the next token based on the input sequence.
Samples the next token based on the predicted probabilities.
Updates the input sequence with the newly predicted token.

Continuous Text Generation
To continuously generate text every 10 seconds, we run a loop that calls the generate_text function repeatedly. This allows for real-time text generation based on the model's learning.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a simple text generation model using a feedforward neural network. Although the architecture is basic, it lays the foundation for understanding more complex models like RNNs or Transformers. The model generates text based on patterns learned from the training data, allowing for creative outputs.
